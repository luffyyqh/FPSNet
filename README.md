evaluation of pose estimation: data and code

There are two evaluation algorithms for pose estimation: minutiae pairs and indexing, you can run the matlab code for evaluation the existing results or run exe to evaluate your own pose results.

NIST SD4: both minutiae pairs and indexing

NIST SD27: minutiae pairs

FVC2004 DB1A: indexing

NIST SD14 is too large to upload to github, if you are interested, contact me at yinqh14@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn for the results and evaluation codes.
