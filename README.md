evaluation of pose estimation: data and code

There are two evaluation algorithms for pose estimation: minutiae pairs and indexing, you can run the matlab code for evaluation the existing results or run exe to evaluate your own pose results.

NIST SD4: both minutiae pairs and indexing

NIST SD27: minutiae pairs

FVC2004 DB1A: indexing

The MCC features for NIST SD14 is too large to upload to github, thus we only uploaded the pose estimated by corresponding algorithms. if you are interested, contact me at yinqh14@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn for the MCC features and evaluation codes.
